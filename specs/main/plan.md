# Implementation Plan: Responsive RPS Simulation UI

**Branch**: `[001-responsive-ui]` | **Date**: 2025-10-24 | **Spec**: `/specs/main/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/main/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. All guidance below reflects the constitution for the RPS Simulation Browser App.

## Summary

Deliver a browser-only, single-page rock-paper-scissors simulator that auto-generates moves after players enter their names, visualizes each round via a circular participant panel with countdown and emoji animations, and maintains waiting and history panels per mode. Implementation relies on vanilla HTML/CSS/JS while ensuring Korean console logging for observability and responsive layout proportions across desktop viewports.

**Scope (2025-10-24)**: Initial build implements User Stories 1–3 with manual Chrome/Firefox validation and no auxiliary tooling beyond static assets.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla browser APIs only)  
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory simulation)  
**Testing**: Manual browser verification (no automated frameworks)  
**Target Platform**: Modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox)  
**Project Type**: Single-page static web application  
**Performance Goals**: Instant load from static files; round resolution within one animation frame  
**Constraints**: Must run offline from static files; no build or bundling steps  
**Scale/Scope**: Supports ad-hoc local sessions with small participant lists (≤16 names recommended)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- `I. Browser-Only Delivery`: Plan keeps the experience within static HTML/CSS/JS assets and avoids backend services or build tooling.
- `II. Auto Simulation Flow`: Flow design guarantees that only participant names are requested and the game auto-resolves each round, including tie handling.
- `III. Korean Console Observability`: Implementation notes include Korean-language console logging coverage for initialization, each round, ties, and final summary.
- `IV. Minimal Tooling Footprint`: Approach relies on vanilla browser APIs, excludes Git-based workflows, and documents manual validation steps.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single static bundle rooted at repository top-level (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`). Additions require justification against Principle IV.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Phase 0: Research & Open Questions

1. Validate responsive radial layout techniques that keep participant names legible while adapting to 768–1440px widths without external libraries.
2. Confirm countdown and animation strategy using native `requestAnimationFrame` and CSS transitions to maintain 60fps goals.
3. Document manual multi-browser validation checklist covering Korean console logs, history/waiting order, and popup termination flows.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

- Derive data model for `Participant`, `Round`, and `GameState` including status transitions (active → waiting) per mode.
- Capture non-network “contracts” by documenting internal event flow hooks and DOM structure expectations since no external API exists.
- Produce quickstart guide outlining static file execution, browser validation steps, and console inspection requirements.

## Phase 2 Preview (Tasks command will elaborate)

- Implement responsive layout with CSS grid/flex plus radial positioning script.
- Build simulation engine handling countdown tiers, random move assignment, stalemate replays, and panel synchronization.
- Integrate Korean console logging utilities and manual validation scripts/checklists.

## Constitution Check (Post-Design)

All design artifacts (research, data model, quickstart, contracts) maintain compliance with Principles I–IV: still browser-only, automation ensured, Korean console logging mandated, and tooling remains vanilla without external frameworks.
