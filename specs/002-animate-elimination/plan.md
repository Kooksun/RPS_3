# Implementation Plan: Animated Elimination Exit

**Branch**: `002-animate-elimination` | **Date**: 2025-10-27 | **Spec**: [specs/002-animate-elimination/spec.md](specs/002-animate-elimination/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-animate-elimination/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. All guidance below reflects the constitution for the RPS Simulation Browser App.

## Summary

Introduce a post-result elimination animation that plays after the existing 3초 dwell, ensuring 탈락자 visibly leave the 원형 게임패널 before the simulation advances. Leverage current vanilla JS render pipeline to time the animation, coordinate waiting 패널 updates, and respect the static bundle constraints.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla browser APIs only)  
**Storage**: In-memory state objects (`GameState`, `state.game`)  
**Testing**: Manual browser verification in Chrome + Firefox with simulation walkthrough  
**Target Platform**: Modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox)  
**Project Type**: Single-page static web application  
**Performance Goals**: Static assets load instantly; decisive round transition (dwell + animation) completes ≤4초  
**Constraints**: Must run offline from static files; no build or bundling steps; animation respects prefers-reduced-motion  
**Scale/Scope**: Supports ad-hoc local sessions with up to 12 active participants per current limit  
**Unknowns / NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: None identified (animation sequencing fully defined in spec)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- `I. Browser-Only Delivery`: Animation logic will be authored in existing static assets (`app.js`, `styles.css`) with no new build pipeline or external hosting needs. ✅
- `II. Auto Simulation Flow`: Simulation still auto-generates moves and progresses after the dwell + animation window without user input changes. ✅
- `III. Korean Console Observability`: Console logs will be extended if needed to narrate animation start/end in Korean, maintaining full coverage. ✅
- `IV. Minimal Tooling Footprint`: Implementation uses CSS transitions and requestAnimationFrame within vanilla JS; manual two-browser validation remains the proof step. ✅

**Post-Phase-1 Review**: Design artifacts (data model, contracts, quickstart) stay within these constraints; no gate violations detected.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single static bundle rooted at repository top-level (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`). Additions require justification against Principle IV.

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
