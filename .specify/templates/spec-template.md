# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

Prioritize user journeys by impact (P1 highest). Each story must deliver a standalone slice that can be demonstrated by opening `index.html` in a browser, entering names, and observing the automated simulation plus Korean console logs.

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: Launch the static bundle in a browser, input representative participant names for this story, run the simulation, and confirm UI output plus Korean console trace for each step.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: Manual browser run focusing on this specific enhancement while verifying console narration remains Korean and exhaustive.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: Manual browser run exercising this story in isolation; confirm simulation auto-resolves and logs remain localized.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- Duplicate participant names entered accidentally
- Blank input submitted or only whitespace provided
- Odd number of participants (auto-handle by granting byes or replaying)
- Long names that may overflow the layout
- Browser refresh mid-simulation

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Interface MUST collect participant names and start the simulation without requiring move selection.
- **FR-002**: Game logic MUST auto-generate rock/paper/scissors choices per round and resolve ties immediately.
- **FR-003**: UI MUST display round-by-round outcomes plus the overall winner with clear labeling.
- **FR-004**: Console MUST emit Korean-language logs covering initialization, round results, tie handling, and final summary.
- **FR-005**: The bundle MUST remain a static HTML/CSS/JS set that runs offline with no build tooling.
- **FR-006**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION [Document any ambiguity uncovered during research, e.g., "Should we support tournament brackets beyond pairwise play?"]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Participant**: Name string captured from the UI and used in simulations.
- **Round Result**: Combination of participant names, generated moves, winner state, and descriptive text for UI/console rendering.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can complete a simulation from name entry to winner display in under 30 seconds.
- **SC-002**: Every round emits at least one Korean-language console message describing the action taken.
- **SC-003**: Simulation runs offline in Chrome and Firefox without errors or missing assets.
- **SC-004**: Manual regression checklist executed with zero blocking issues before distribution.
