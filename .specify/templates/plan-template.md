# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. All guidance below reflects the constitution for the RPS Simulation Browser App.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla browser APIs only)  
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory simulation)  
**Testing**: Manual browser verification (no automated frameworks)  
**Target Platform**: Modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox)  
**Project Type**: Single-page static web application  
**Performance Goals**: Instant load from static files; round resolution within one animation frame  
**Constraints**: Must run offline from static files; no build or bundling steps  
**Scale/Scope**: Supports ad-hoc local sessions with small participant lists (≤16 names recommended)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- `I. Browser-Only Delivery`: Plan keeps the experience within static HTML/CSS/JS assets and avoids backend services or build tooling.
- `II. Auto Simulation Flow`: Flow design guarantees that only participant names are requested and the game auto-resolves each round, including tie handling.
- `III. Korean Console Observability`: Implementation notes include Korean-language console logging coverage for initialization, each round, ties, and final summary.
- `IV. Minimal Tooling Footprint`: Approach relies on vanilla browser APIs, excludes Git-based workflows, and documents manual validation steps.

├── styles.css           # Styling for the simulation page
└── app.js               # Game logic and console logging
```

**Structure Decision**: Single static bundle rooted at repository top-level (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`). Additions require justification against Principle IV.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
