# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No automated frameworks are used. Validation relies on manual browser runs documented in the spec and plan.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each increment can ship independently while honoring the constitution.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)  
- **[Story]**: User story reference (e.g., US1, US2, US3)  
- Always include exact file paths (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, etc.)

## Path Conventions

- Static bundle lives at repository root (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`)  
- Create `assets/` only when a static resource is unavoidable‚Äîjustify additions in plan.md  
- No `src/`, `tests/`, or backend directories are permitted without a constitution amendment

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
  
  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3‚Ä¶)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Contracts/ directory contents (when present)
  
  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently (manual browser run)
  - Delivered as an MVP increment
  
  Manual validation (console inspection, multi-browser check) counts as work and should be listed.
  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Static Bundle Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Establish the minimal HTML/CSS/JS skeleton

- [ ] T001 Create or adjust `index.html` structure with participant input form and simulation trigger
- [ ] T002 Define baseline layout and typography in `styles.css`
- [ ] T003 [P] Scaffold `app.js` with simulation namespace, state reset helpers, and console logging utility

---

## Phase 2: Foundational Simulation Logic (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Ensure automation works before story-specific UI changes

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until automatic move generation and tie handling are implemented.

- [ ] T004 Model participant data and validation rules inside `app.js`
- [ ] T005 Implement random move generator using native browser APIs with deterministic tie replay
- [ ] T006 Connect simulation loop to name inputs, enforcing zero additional user decisions

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready‚Äîuser story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: Manual browser run verifying UI output and Korean console narration for this story.

### Manual Validation for User Story 1

- [ ] T010 Document Chrome validation steps (with expected Korean log snippets) in `/specs/[###-feature-name]/quickstart.md`
- [ ] T011 Capture screenshots and console excerpts demonstrating success criteria

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Render participant form and action controls within `index.html`
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Wire name capture, sanitization, and handoff to simulation in `app.js`
- [ ] T014 [US1] Update `styles.css` for layout adjustments required by new UI elements
- [ ] T015 [US1] Render round summaries and final winner to the DOM with clear labels

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 delivers a fully automated simulation slice and can be demoed independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: Manual browser run (typically Firefox) verifying new behavior plus Korean console coverage.

### Manual Validation for User Story 2

- [ ] T018 Record Korean console output and UI behavior in Firefox, noting any differences from Chrome

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T019 [US2] Extend simulation logic in `app.js` for the story-specific rules (document adjustments)
- [ ] T020 [US2] Update DOM rendering for added data or status indicators
- [ ] T021 [US2] Ensure new events emit localized console messages with consistent formatting

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 AND 2 run independently and meet console observability requirements

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: Manual regression across supported browsers; verify automation and logging remain intact.

### Manual Validation for User Story 3

- [ ] T022 Execute regression suite in Chrome and Firefox; annotate deviations and resolutions in `/specs/.../quickstart.md`

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T023 [P] [US3] Introduce additional UI elements in `index.html` (e.g., history panel, controls)
- [ ] T024 [US3] Adjust `styles.css` for accessibility/responsiveness without adding frameworks
- [ ] T025 [US3] Refine `app.js` to support the new scenario while preserving automated flow

**Checkpoint**: All prioritized user stories operate independently with full Korean console coverage

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Hardening and documentation updates affecting multiple stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Update relevant docs (plan.md, quickstart.md, changelog)
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring in `app.js`
- [ ] TXXX Optimize DOM updates to minimize reflow/repaint costs
- [ ] TXXX Verify Korean console coverage remains complete after refactors
- [ ] TXXX Run manual quickstart validation against the latest build

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies‚Äîstart immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1‚ÄîBLOCKS all user stories
- **Phase 3+ (User Stories)**: Depend on Phase 2 completion; run sequentially by priority or in parallel if staffing allows
- **Phase N (Polish)**: Depends on all targeted user stories reaching their checkpoints

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Starts after foundational tasks; no downstream dependencies
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Starts after foundational tasks; may reuse US1 outputs but must remain independently demoable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Starts after foundational tasks; can build on US1/US2 but must respect automated flow mandates

### Within Each User Story

- Document manual validation expectations before coding
- Simulation/state logic updates precede DOM rendering tweaks
- DOM updates precede styling polish
- Polish and documentation wrap up the story

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup tasks marked `[P]` can run in parallel
- Foundational tasks marked `[P]` can run in parallel (within Phase 2 scope)
- Once the foundation is complete, different user stories may proceed in parallel if they touch different UI elements/files
- Manual validation tasks can execute as soon as supporting implementation tasks finish

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Example sequencing (adjust per feature)
# Developer A
open index.html  # Modify markup for participant form
# Developer B
open app.js      # Wire submission handler and simulation trigger
```
